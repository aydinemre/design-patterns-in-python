[Single Responsibility Principle](srp.py)
- A class should only have one reason to change.
- Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

[Open-Closed Principle](ocp.py)
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

[Liskov Substition Principle](lsp.py)
- You should be able to substitute a base type for subtype

[Interface Segregation Principle](isp.py)
- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
- YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

[Dependency Inversion Principle](dip.py)
- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
